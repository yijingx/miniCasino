# üé∞ Mini Casino Backend

This is a simple Spring Boot backend for a mini casino application. It supports user registration, betting, game management, and XML-based game importing.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Project

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Java 17 or later  
- Maven 3.6+  
- IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, VS Code) or terminal access  
- (Optional) Postman or Swagger UI for testing

---

### üöÄ Run the Application

#### Option 1: Using an IDE

1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Locate and run the main class:
   ```
   com.erika.minicasino.MiniCasinoApplication
   ```

#### Option 2: Using the terminal

```bash
# Navigate to the project root
cd MiniCasino

# Build the project
mvn clean install

# Run the application
mvn spring-boot:run
```

---

### üåê API Access

Once running, the application is available at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

#### ‚úÖ Swagger UI

Use Swagger UI to explore and test APIs interactively:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```

### üìÇ Game Initialization from XML

The game list can be initialized or updated using one of the following methods:

---

#### ‚úÖ Option 1: Load from `games.xml` at Startup

At application startup, the system attempts to load games from a file named:

```
src/main/resources/games.xml
```

- If the file exists and is valid, the game list is loaded from it.
- If the file does **not** exist, the system automatically falls back to **default hardcoded game data** (see Option 2).
- This logic is handled during the construction of `GameServiceImpl`.

```xml
<!-- Example games.xml format -->
<games>
  <game>
    <id>1</id>
    <name>Slot Machine</name>
    <chanceOfWinning>0.2</chanceOfWinning>
    <winningMultiplier>5.0</winningMultiplier>
    <minBet>1.0</minBet>
    <maxBet>100.0</maxBet>
  </game>
  <!-- Add more game entries here -->
</games>
```

---

#### ‚úÖ Option 2: Use Default In-Memory Game List

If `games.xml` is not found at startup, the following default games are loaded:

```java
private void initializeGames() {
    gameMap.put(1L, new Game(1L, "Slot Machine", 0.2, 5.0, 1.0, 100.0));
    gameMap.put(2L, new Game(2L, "Roulette", 0.4, 2.5, 2.0, 50.0));
    gameMap.put(3L, new Game(3L, "Blackjack", 0.5, 2.0, 5.0, 200.0));
}
```

These are useful as demo or fallback content for development and testing.

---

#### ‚úÖ Option 3: Upload XML via API (Runtime Update)

You can dynamically upload and overwrite the game list **after the application has started** using the `/game/upload-xml` endpoint.

- **Method:** `POST`
- **Endpoint:** `/game/upload-xml`
- **Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`
- **Form Field:** `file`

Supported via:

- **Swagger UI** ‚Üí [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)
- **Postman** or curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/game/upload-xml \
  -F "file=@src/main/resources/games.xml"
```

‚úÖ **Note:** When uploading, the existing in-memory game list is completely **cleared** before adding the new games from XML.

---

### üß™ Running Tests

```bash
mvn test
```

Tests include user registration, deposit, bet placement, balance checks, and game loading.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features (Per Requirements)

- **List games and their details:**  
  `GET /game` and `GET /game/{id}` endpoints return all available games and their individual details.

- **Register a player:**  
  `POST /user/register` allows a player to register with name, username, and birthdate. Age validation (18+) is enforced.

- **Place a bet as a player and return result:**  
  `POST /user/placeBet` lets a player place a bet on a game. The outcome (win/loss), payout, and record are returned.

- **Get the balance of the player:**  
  `GET /user/balance` returns the current balance of the specified player.

- **Deposit money as a player:**  
  `POST /user/deposit` allows a player to add funds to their balance.

---

## üåü Bonus Features (Implemented)

- **Game initialization from XML**
   - Loads `games.xml` at startup if available
   - Falls back to default in-memory games if no file is found
   - Supports uploading a new game list via API (`POST /game/upload-xml`) ‚Äî replacing the existing list dynamically

- **Server-managed bet history**
   - Bet records are added server-side only
   - Users cannot manually inject or modify their bet history (secured using `@JsonProperty(access = READ_ONLY)`)

- **Bet summary endpoint**
   - `GET /user/betSummary` returns number of bets, total bet amount, and total winnings for a user

- **Full Swagger/OpenAPI integration**
   - All endpoints documented with request/response examples, error responses, and input validation annotations
   - API available via Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`

- **Well-structured response format**
   - Consistent `BaseResponse<T>` wrapper used for all API responses with `code`, `message`, `data`, and `description`

- **Unit tests**
   - Comprehensive unit tests for both service and controller layers, covering registration, betting, game upload, etc.

### üí° Tips

- To customize the startup games, edit or add `games.xml` in `src/main/resources`.
- All API responses are wrapped in `BaseResponse<T>` with fields: `code`, `message`, `data`, and (if error) `description`.
